#  Iris Flower Classification using Machine Learning

##  Internship Details
- **Program:** Oasis Infobyte Internship (OIBSIP)
- **Domain:** Machine Learning
- **Task:** Iris Flower Classification
- **Project Type:** Classification + Web Application (Flask)


##  Project Description
The Iris flower has three species — **Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica** — which differ based on their physical measurements.  
This project aims to build a **machine learning classification model** that learns from iris flower measurements and accurately predicts the species.

The project is developed as part of the **Oasis Infobyte Internship Program (OIBSIP)** to gain hands-on experience in machine learning and model deployment using Flask.


##  Objective
- To train a machine learning model using the Iris dataset
- To classify iris flowers into their respective species
- To deploy the trained model using a Flask web application


##  Dataset
The dataset contains the following features:

| Feature Name     | Description              |
|------------------|--------------------------|
| SepalLengthCm   | Sepal length in cm       |
| SepalWidthCm    | Sepal width in cm        |
| PetalLengthCm   | Petal length in cm       |
| PetalWidthCm    | Petal width in cm        |
| Species         | Iris flower species      |

- Dataset Source: Scikit-learn / CSV file
- File Name: `Iris.csv`


## ⚙️ Steps Performed
1. Imported required libraries
2. Loaded and explored the dataset
3. Performed data preprocessing
4. Encoded target labels
5. Split data into training and testing sets
6. Trained the machine learning model
7. Evaluated model accuracy
8. Saved the trained model
9. Built a Flask web application
10. Predicted iris species through user input
11. 

##  Machine Learning Algorithm Used
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**

##  Tools & Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Flask
- Jupyter Notebook
- HTML


##  Web Application
A Flask-based web application is developed where users can enter iris flower measurements and get the predicted species in real time.

### Input Features:
- Sepal Length
- Sepal Width
- Petal Length
- Petal Width

### Output:
- Predicted Iris Species (Setosa / Versicolor / Virginica)


##  Results
The trained model successfully classifies iris flowers with good accuracy.  
The web application correctly predicts the species based on user-provided measurements.
